Appendicies

======

These files contain all of the wordlists used in each experiment. For experiments 1 and 3, the files take the form:

CUE | DOMINANT TARGET | SUBORDINATE TARGET | UNRELATED TARGET

In experiment 1, there is an unrelated target matched along length and word frequency to the dominant and subordinate target, respectively. This was discontinued in experiments 2 and 3 as there was no significant difference between the two unrelated targets for a given cue.

For Experiment 2, the file takes the form:

HOMOGRAPH TYPE | HOMOGRAPH BIAS | CUE | DOMINANT TARGET | SUBORDINATE | UNRELATED

We used homographs that have either two nominal meanings or one nominal and one verbal meaning. The HOMOGRAPH TYPE column differentiates between these two. The HOMOGrAPH BIAS column is used to indicate, for NV homographs, whether the dominant meaning is a noun or a verb.
