Datasets, test programs, and documentation for my research of semantic satiation.

Semantic satiation refers to the increase in response time in relatedness judgments following the repeated and frequentitive access of a word and its meaning. (E.g., if you see the word GIRAFFE repeated 30 times, this theory predicts that you'll probably take longer to figure out whether GIRAFFE and EVEN-TOED UNGULATE are related than if you've only seen GIRAFFE 3 times. Although how familiar you are with even-toed ungulates is a totally different matter...)

The only little issue is that we don't know if the effect really exists: some experiments have found it; others haven't. See Esposito & Pelton's review of the literature up through the early 70s for a great laugh at all the fun methodologies used historically if you have the time and interest. Even still, however, methodologies vary considerably, effect sizes are small, how satiation is actually defined is up in the air (is it the difference in response times between short and long repetitions; is it the rate of change as a function of repetition; is it the change in response time at a given repetition relative to the response times for an unrelated pairmate; etc.).

So that's fun, right?

This all considered, this project looks at a couple things: namely ambiguous words in the context of semantic satiation and whether the effect exists at all or if we're just all wasting our time trying to observe it.

To point 1, I'm curious whether there's a difference in satiation for the dominant or subordinate meaning of a homograph. (E.g., given the word CALF, most people will first think of a baby cow. That's the dominant meaning. Fewer will think of a part of your leg. That's the subordinate meaning. A homograph is a word that has one spelling and multiple distinct meanings.) In other words, if I show you CALF 30 times, will your response time figuring out whether CALF --- COW are related will differ from your response time for CALF --- LEG. In the first experiment, this is confined to homographs with two noun meanings; in the second, homographs are used that have either two noun meanings or one noun and one verb meaning.

To the second point, we've got a meta-analysis to conduct! All prior attempts to assess whether the effect, oh, actually exists or not have been narrative reviews of the literature. That's insufficient, in my mind. That's not rigorous or empirical. So I'm conducting a formal statistical evaluation of the body of semantic satiation literature from the late 1970s through the present.

All data, test programs, analyses, data clean-up procedures, etc. will be included for all experiments. Because reproducability is a really dandy thing that researchers don't typically pay enough attention to. So please, download the data if you're researching semantic satiation. Play with them; analyze them; critique my own methods; confirm or refute my results.
