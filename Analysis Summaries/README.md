Summary of Analyses
===================

What is included
----------------

This folder includes more analyses and results than were reported in our manuscript or in the R markdown files that are included in each experiment's individual folder. The analyses reported there are restricted largely to only those whose results were cited in the manuscript.

We felt it was appropriate to include additional analyses here to better reflect how our analyses evolved and, ultimately, were chosen for reporting. Importantly, we report here the same analyses as in our manuscript, though using different cutoffs to trim outliers and other so-called 'bad' data.

In doing so, we hope to illustrate that our results did not come from a vacuum, bur were rather reported in view of a number of other analyses. Specifically, these analyses do help to show that our reported results remain largely consistent, regardless of trimming strategy used, and were not simple cherry-picked to best support our hypotheses and conform to prior literature.

Outlier Trimming Strategies
---------------------------

For Experiments 1a and 2, we report analyses based on:

1. The full dataset with **no** data points removed from the raw participant files;

2. The data, having removed all incorrect responses;

3. The data, having removed all incorrect responses and items with an RT <200ms (i.e., those for which participants could not have physically had time to read the words onscreen and make a relatedness judgment on that basis);

4. The data, having removed all incorrect responses, items with an RT <200ms, and all items with an RT more than 3sd above or below that participant's mean response time; and

5. The data, having removed all incorrect responses, items with an RT <200ms, and all items with an RT more than 1.5x the IQR above the third quartile or below the first quartile RT for that participant.
